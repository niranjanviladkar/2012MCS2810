Human Activity Recognition is an important vision problem.
In recent years, there have been various approaches towards the problem
\cite{actionsInContext,Realistic,improving,Parking}.
Most existing approaches perform classification of video clips 
based on low level features like HoG-HoF. They don't consider the domain knowledge while classification.
This methodology is vulnerable to noisy training data.

For example, presence of two persons in a clip increases chances of activity `conversation',
a partial occlusion in the scene will lead to different low level features.
Thus low level features may not be able to capture the information conveyed by 
the presence of two persons effectively.

This project adds domain knowledge in the form of object and people information
to the classification using Markov Logic. Markov Logic captures semantic relationship
using weighted first order logic formulae. Thus the model learnt is less vulnerable to noisy
training data and occlusions.

This project gives an end to end system for activity recognition. It takes input from 
a video classifier and an object detector and builds semantic model on top of this information.
Activity predictions using this approach shows improvement over the existing frameworks.
