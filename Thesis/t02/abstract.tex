Human Activity Recognition in a video has been extensively studied upon area. 
Various approaches include classification of video clips based on features like SIFT, HoG-HoF, scene, etc.
These experiments are done on a standard dataset, so the results are comparable.

All the previous approaches use classification based on features in the video but they don't consider the domain knowledge while classification.
This project intends to add domain knowledge to the classification in the form of first order logic formulae.

Classical first order logic consists of hard rules. 
If a formula is not satisfiable even in one world, 
the formula is considered to be false. 
Such hard constraints can not be applied to the real world predicates. 
This project uses inference using Markov Logic Network 
to associate probabilities with formulae instead of their true/falsehood.

Finally a comparison of activity predictions beetween 
approach of this project and 
published work is shown on the standard action video dataset.
