My sincere thanks to my project guide, Dr. Parag Singla.
I am grateful to have his constant support and motivation
during the difficulties that I faced at various stages of the project. 
He not only guided me towards the solutions to the problems but encouraged 
me to learn the concepts that gave me insights into the subject. I am thankful 
to Dr. Subhashis Banerjee, he gave me directions for the project in initial stages.

I thank Ruchin Kukreja and Arunim Samat 
for their help with acquiring data sets and initial project setup.

I would also like to thank Happy Mittal, a Ph.D scholar at the Department of Computer Science, IIT Delhi, 
who helped me understand markov logic networks and use of alchemy.
