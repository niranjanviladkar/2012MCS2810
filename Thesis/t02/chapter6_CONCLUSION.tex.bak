\label{ch6_CONCLUSION}

Various experiments aimed at improving video activity recognition were performed during this project.
Approaches included experiments using MLNs and adding tf-idf information to SVM learning.
It was found that adding object and people information to the existing recognition framework
improves the precision results.

Moreover, wherever there is a relationship beetween action and object, that can be represented by first order logic,
markov logic networks effectively capture the relationship.

The system developed by this project builds on top of video recognizer and object detector.
Higher the precision of both of these systems, higher the precision of overall system.
